- The context menu is buggy as shit and likes to go where ever it wants
- No mobile support yet
- The SW is buggy and will sometimes return 'Service not ready', probably because it kills itself
- the FS API can be a pain to work with
- Theres no way to close the context menu easily
- State between the install/open button in the RepoStore is jank
- Sometimes resizing a window over a window can be laggy
- The bootsplash should be modified because it looks weird on prod but its fine
- reloading with ctrl + shift + r causes the bootsplash to not load
